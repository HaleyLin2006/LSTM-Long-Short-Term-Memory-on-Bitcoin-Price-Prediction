# LSTM-Long-Short-Term-Memory-on-Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
During this project, I used LSTM to create a model predicting the future Bitcoin price, and it's rocket high! In the process I encounter some problem where the predcited price is a simple constant line. I had successfully deal with this problem with normalization before plugging numbers into the model.
